# Package for daily usage vim 

## Why ?

This package is for my person need in vim.
The idea was to have some help files, where
I describe the features that I have in vim

## Installation 

This works beautiful in vim 8, which now 
should be the default.

For me vim has a lot of hidden. One of these
is the package manager, which i discovered 
today.

For installation:

git clone https://github.com/jmetzger/vim-day2day.git ~/.vim/pack/

Then restart your vim and you can get the help 
with:

:help myhelp
